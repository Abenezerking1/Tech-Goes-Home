            Tech Goes Homeâ€™s programming addresses digital exclusion as an issue that is part and parcel of the many inequities that exist in our society today as a result of generations of systemic racism and social injustice, and helps ensure that everyone has the tools and knowledge necessary to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the digital world.</p>
